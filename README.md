Number in days (Integer)

### `change-falure-rate`

Number of registered issues tagged as bugs divided by number of release tags last month.
By counting the bugs (github issues tagged as `bug`) between releases the last month and average this, we get the failures over releases rate.
Number in range 0 - 100 (%)

### `mttr`

Mean time to restore. This metric is calculated based on the time between the last release before an issue tagged as a bug and the first release after the bug is closed.
For this to work correctly we must assume github issues are created for all unwanted issues in production and that all changes to production is done through releases.
