## Inputs

### `repo`

Repository from where to read issues and statuses. List one or more repositories, either as one single string, as an array or all separated by newlines.
Valid formats are:

```yaml
repo: my-repo
```

```yaml
repo: [my-repo, my-other-repo]
```

```yaml
repo: 
    my-repo

```

Default repo value is repo where action is installed if no repos are spefied.

### `owner`

### `token`

## Outputs

### `deploy-frequency`

Rate of deploys (tagged releases) per week.
Decimal number. Elite performing teams has 7 as target (daily- or on-demand release)

### `lead-time`

Time from issue is set to status doing until linked pull-requestis merged to main branch.
Number in days (Integer)

### `change-falure-rate`

Number of registered issues tagged as bugs divided by number of release tags last month.
By counting the bugs (github issues tagged as `bug`) between releases the last month and average this, we get the failures over releases rate.
Number in range 0 - 100 (%)

### `mttr`

Mean time to restore. This metric is calculated based on the time between the last release before an issue tagged as a bug and the first release after the bug is closed.
For this to work correctly we must assume github issues are created for all unwanted issues in production and that all changes to production is done through releases.
Number in hours (integer)
